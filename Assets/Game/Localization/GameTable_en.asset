      The inhabitants of the city and surrounding
      villages are sounding the alarm!

      A gigantic black spider has appeared
      in the forest, wreaking havoc on the nearby village.

      It is strongly
      advised to avoid visiting this area for your own safety!


      For an experienced
      monster hunter, a reward is offered for defeating the beast!

      The brave
      one who accomplishes this feat will be rewarded by the king himself!


      Battle
      Challenge!


      On the castle square, a commander of orcs has emerged with
      a small detachment, challenging anyone

      who is able to take him on in
      battle!

      However, this is no ordinary orc; he is a powerful, battle-hardened
      warrior.

      He awaits courageous challengers at the square behind the castle.
      A reward from the king awaits those who can defeat him!'
